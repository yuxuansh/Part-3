# Part-3

In the final data story, people at large are my audience. It seems to be wide but it should be because issue of food related to everyone. Every single person can do something to help. 

Since I didn't put my story on shorthand in Part2, the biggest change I've made is to design it online. My story goes in an order of "What-Why-How". I discussed the definition of food insecurity and present the current situation in U.S at the beginning. Then, I discussed three causes of the issue. Finally, for "Call to Action" part, I give three suggestions for audiences. 

Drawing graphs took a lot of time because there are too many things to consider, for example, which type fits best, which color looks good, etc. I have changed many times to make graphs look compatible. Basically, I used blue, yellow, and grey most frequently. Blue and yellow are generally used to make contrast. Grey is for data that are insignificant. Bar charts and pie charts are the most used. 

Background pictures are selected carefully. I used some miserable photos and dark color in the front part in order to make people recognize the seriousness of the problem. Start from "What can we do?" part, I used light color and photos which are more positive. It is to show we have a promising future if everyone can help. 

In Part2 interview, my interviewees mentioned that I used too many words. I have tried to cut some paragraphs but still keep some as explanation to charts. I found it beneficial to make a wireframe before the real work because it will be faster to draw if I have a structure in mind.
